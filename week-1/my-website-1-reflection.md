Open source refers to software that is open to the creative commons. Unlike cost associated software, anyone who has the technical savvy can open tools and modify them through the backend. It also supports sharing ideas and is free! 

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
