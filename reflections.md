# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection


## 1.2 The Command Line 
What is a shell? What is "bash?"
The shell is the command-line interpreter interface where bash is a one of the most common types of a command-line shell. They work together to run commands to the operating system. 
What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
The most challenging part of this material was unlearning bad habits I've developed in working in the command line with out instruction. I became used to a previous company's methods and library without understanding the basics of programming in the shell. 

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands? 
Yes! Eventually. 

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
ls -l  gives you details about files, including if they are executable and permission states
cd gives you the ability to navigate through your folder structure an ultimately this structure will help you stay organized
export is great because it allows you to set variables, which is a basic building block of programming 

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd - print the working directory 
-ls - get details about a file 
-mv - move a file or directory
-cd - change directory
-../ - go up one folder 
-touch - create an empty file 
-mkdir - create a director 
-less - allows you to scroll through a document's contents one page at a time 
-rmdir - remove a directory that is empty
-rm - remove a file or directory 
-help -provides information on the command, including expected arguments 

### 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection 
Creating and forking repositories are two ways to add a repo to your GitHub account. Once they are in your account, you can download them to your computer using the clone command in git. To create a repository, navigate to your account and select the "+" button, then "New repository." Insert the criteria for your repo and click "create repository." Voil√†! You have a new, empty repository. To copy a repository to your account, navigate to the repository you desire, and select the "fork" icon. This will open a new, identical repo in your account with all its associated files.  The last step is to clone the new or forked repo to your computer via git in the command line. Copy the https clone url from your repository's GitHub page. enter the following commands in the terminal to clone the repo to your computer:

cd your_local_loaction

git clone your_https_url 

 

During this process, I found deleting the repo most challenging, because it was not explicitly stated, and my first attempts were unsuccessful. I learned to research things and roll with the punches
